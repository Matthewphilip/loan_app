# Loan Request Application - React

## Introduction & project aim

App built in React (version 18.2.0) rendering a financial loan request application form. The apps aim is to allow users to request a loan for 'x' amount (in pounds), select a repayment term (from a selection of three set terms) and submit the request for consideration. Input validations will prevent submissions with missing fields, and throw errors if:

- both fields are missing entries
- loan amount is missing
- loan amount is less than Â£1
- loan term is not stated

Any errors will be rendered in a modal, with the error message rendered depending on the failed validation.
If all fields are entered a success message will be rendered in a modal with the loan amount requested and the loan replayment term stated.
